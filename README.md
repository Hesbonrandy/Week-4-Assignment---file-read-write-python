# File Read & Write Program

This Python program reads content from an existing file, modifies it, and writes the modified version into a new file.  
It also includes error handling to manage common file-related issues.

---

## **Features**
- Reads text from an input file.
- Modifies the content (default: converts text to uppercase).
- Writes the modified text to a new output file.
- Handles errors such as:
  - File not found
  - Permission denied
  - Other unexpected errors

## **How It Works**
1. The program asks for the **name of the file to read**.
2. It **reads** the file's content.
3. The content is **modified** (converted to uppercase by default).
4. It asks for the **name of the new file to write to**.
5. The **modified content** is saved in the new file.
